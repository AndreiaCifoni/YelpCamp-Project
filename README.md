# YelpCamp-Project
Full stack project from Colt Steele Bootcamp

## About the project
This project is a page for people to post and see campgrounds around the world. 
  
It has an iterative map that will point the amount of campgrounds in a certain region. 
Also, you can check the photos of each place, its price and description, and the hanked review with coments leaved for previous costumers about their experiences.
    
### Built with
The main code language, libraries and frameworks used in this project:

* JavaScript
* Express
* Node.js
* EJS
* Mongodb
* Mongoose
* Cloudinary
* Mapbox
* Bootstrap


## Getting Started
No prerequisites or installation needed. Since the application is already deployed, the client just need to enter in the following web page:
[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)

## Usage
When entering for the first time in the YelpCamp page, the user is allowed to view the list of campgrounds and coments but he/she will not be authorized to further actions.

The Register (for first time users) or Login section is require for creating a new campground and make a comment in one location that already exists.

Users can either choose the location by the iterative map or by the specific name of campground listed. By zooming out the map, the clusters of numbers will show the amount of camp sites in that region.

Delete and edit functions of campgrounds and reviews/comments are exclusive authorized for the creator of this contents.
